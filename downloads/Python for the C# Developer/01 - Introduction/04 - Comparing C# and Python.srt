00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:01,06
- [Instructor] If you're already

2
00:00:01,06 --> 00:00:03,06
an experienced C# developer,

3
00:00:03,06 --> 00:00:04,05
you might be wondering,

4
00:00:04,05 --> 00:00:07,03
what's so special about Python and why learn it?

5
00:00:07,03 --> 00:00:10,01
After all C# and .NET are pretty popular

6
00:00:10,01 --> 00:00:11,09
and have been around for quite some time now,

7
00:00:11,09 --> 00:00:14,01
so why bother learning a new language?

8
00:00:14,01 --> 00:00:16,08
I think there's several great reasons to do so.

9
00:00:16,08 --> 00:00:21,00
First Python programming is very productive and efficient,

10
00:00:21,00 --> 00:00:23,03
especially if you're prototyping something

11
00:00:23,03 --> 00:00:25,09
and you want to try out an idea quickly,

12
00:00:25,09 --> 00:00:28,00
But that doesn't mean you can't do real work with it.

13
00:00:28,00 --> 00:00:31,00
Python is very popular among some fields,

14
00:00:31,00 --> 00:00:33,07
such as data science, financial modeling,

15
00:00:33,07 --> 00:00:37,06
cloud software development, building command line tools,

16
00:00:37,06 --> 00:00:39,00
and a lot more.

17
00:00:39,00 --> 00:00:41,01
Python is also very flexible.

18
00:00:41,01 --> 00:00:43,02
It supports object oriented programming,

19
00:00:43,02 --> 00:00:44,06
so you can use it that way,

20
00:00:44,06 --> 00:00:46,05
or you can just write procedural code

21
00:00:46,05 --> 00:00:48,04
and not worry too much about using objects.

22
00:00:48,04 --> 00:00:49,07
It's up to you.

23
00:00:49,07 --> 00:00:53,02
There's a huge ecosystem built up around Python now.

24
00:00:53,02 --> 00:00:55,08
There are 100s of pre-built code modules

25
00:00:55,08 --> 00:00:57,03
that you can use in your projects,

26
00:00:57,03 --> 00:00:59,03
both built into the standard library,

27
00:00:59,03 --> 00:01:02,06
as well as available from third parties.

28
00:01:02,06 --> 00:01:04,05
Python forms the foundation

29
00:01:04,05 --> 00:01:06,06
of programming for some very popular products

30
00:01:06,06 --> 00:01:09,08
like the Raspberry Pi or the Django web framework,

31
00:01:09,08 --> 00:01:11,00
just to name a couple.

32
00:01:11,00 --> 00:01:13,04
Python runs almost everywhere.

33
00:01:13,04 --> 00:01:16,00
Just about every major operating system supports it,

34
00:01:16,00 --> 00:01:18,02
such as Windows, Mac, and Linux.

35
00:01:18,02 --> 00:01:20,08
So you can run your programs just about on any device

36
00:01:20,08 --> 00:01:22,05
that has a processor.

37
00:01:22,05 --> 00:01:24,01
All right, let's take a high-level look

38
00:01:24,01 --> 00:01:26,05
at C# compared to Python.

39
00:01:26,05 --> 00:01:30,01
So C# is a statically typed language

40
00:01:30,01 --> 00:01:31,08
with some support for dynamic typing,

41
00:01:31,08 --> 00:01:35,03
whereas Python is a dynamically typed language.

42
00:01:35,03 --> 00:01:38,06
C# code is compiled and built into an app

43
00:01:38,06 --> 00:01:40,08
before it is run.

44
00:01:40,08 --> 00:01:42,01
Python doesn't have this step.

45
00:01:42,01 --> 00:01:45,00
The code is just interpreted as it is executed.

46
00:01:45,00 --> 00:01:47,05
This makes Python a little bit slower than C#,

47
00:01:47,05 --> 00:01:49,05
but it makes the process of development

48
00:01:49,05 --> 00:01:51,04
very quick and simple.

49
00:01:51,04 --> 00:01:54,00
The C# language has grown over time

50
00:01:54,00 --> 00:01:56,06
to be very rich and expressive.

51
00:01:56,06 --> 00:01:59,07
There are all kinds of language constructs

52
00:01:59,07 --> 00:02:03,00
to solve a wide variety of programming problems.

53
00:02:03,00 --> 00:02:06,00
Python tends to focus more on simplicity

54
00:02:06,00 --> 00:02:08,07
and doesn't have a lot of the bells and whistles

55
00:02:08,07 --> 00:02:11,04
that languages like C# has.

56
00:02:11,04 --> 00:02:14,07
Historically C# has been used by enterprise

57
00:02:14,07 --> 00:02:16,01
and Azure developers

58
00:02:16,01 --> 00:02:17,05
along with in-house development

59
00:02:17,05 --> 00:02:20,02
for projects like Windows Forms.

60
00:02:20,02 --> 00:02:22,08
Python has found acceptance among data scientists,

61
00:02:22,08 --> 00:02:26,03
server side cloud developers, and hobbyists.

62
00:02:26,03 --> 00:02:27,07
Now both languages of course

63
00:02:27,07 --> 00:02:30,01
have large passionate user bases

64
00:02:30,01 --> 00:02:32,03
and after spending some time with Python yourself,

65
00:02:32,03 --> 00:02:35,00
you're probably going to understand why that is.
