00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:03,01
- [Joe] As a C# developer, you might be wondering

2
00:00:03,01 --> 00:00:05,07
what's with all the excitement about Python?

3
00:00:05,07 --> 00:00:09,01
C# is, of course, a very popular and capable language.

4
00:00:09,01 --> 00:00:11,08
And it's been around for quite some time now.

5
00:00:11,08 --> 00:00:13,08
But Pythons rise as a favorite language

6
00:00:13,08 --> 00:00:16,00
among programmers has happened along with

7
00:00:16,00 --> 00:00:18,03
the industry's shift to embrace open source

8
00:00:18,03 --> 00:00:20,00
and cloud based computing.

9
00:00:20,00 --> 00:00:22,02
Along with evermore powerful computers

10
00:00:22,02 --> 00:00:23,09
that can execute interpreted languages

11
00:00:23,09 --> 00:00:26,03
like Python faster than ever before.

12
00:00:26,03 --> 00:00:27,05
Hi, I'm Joe Marini.

13
00:00:27,05 --> 00:00:29,04
And I've been building software professionally

14
00:00:29,04 --> 00:00:31,06
for some of the biggest companies in Silicon Valley

15
00:00:31,06 --> 00:00:33,03
for more than 30 years.

16
00:00:33,03 --> 00:00:35,01
I've used a lot of programming languages

17
00:00:35,01 --> 00:00:38,05
throughout my career, including both C# and Python.

18
00:00:38,05 --> 00:00:40,01
And each one of them has their strengths

19
00:00:40,01 --> 00:00:41,06
along with their quirks.

20
00:00:41,06 --> 00:00:43,09
In this course, we'll learn about some of the basics

21
00:00:43,09 --> 00:00:47,02
of the Python language and how it compares to C#.

22
00:00:47,02 --> 00:00:49,05
Then we'll see how various features of C#

23
00:00:49,05 --> 00:00:52,06
are implemented in Python, such as the different ways

24
00:00:52,06 --> 00:00:55,00
you can define and use functions,

25
00:00:55,00 --> 00:00:58,04
implement various aspects of object oriented programming

26
00:00:58,04 --> 00:01:02,02
such as defining classes, implementing interfaces,

27
00:01:02,02 --> 00:01:03,07
and abstract classes.

28
00:01:03,07 --> 00:01:05,09
And make use of the Python collection types

29
00:01:05,09 --> 00:01:07,03
like lists and dictionaries

30
00:01:07,03 --> 00:01:10,03
and see how they compare to their C# versions.

31
00:01:10,03 --> 00:01:13,03
We'll also examine some features that are uniquely Python,

32
00:01:13,03 --> 00:01:15,03
such as magic object methods

33
00:01:15,03 --> 00:01:16,08
and the built-in language functions

34
00:01:16,08 --> 00:01:19,06
that make common data handling operations easy.

35
00:01:19,06 --> 00:01:21,03
Python is a great language to add

36
00:01:21,03 --> 00:01:23,07
to your skillset alongside C#.

37
00:01:23,07 --> 00:01:25,00
So, let's get started.
