00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:01,07
- [Instructor] There are some concepts

2
00:00:01,07 --> 00:00:03,01
that you should already be familiar with

3
00:00:03,01 --> 00:00:04,08
before you start this course.

4
00:00:04,08 --> 00:00:07,06
So let's take a few moments and review what basic knowledge

5
00:00:07,06 --> 00:00:09,01
you should already have.

6
00:00:09,01 --> 00:00:10,04
First, I'm going to assume

7
00:00:10,04 --> 00:00:13,02
that you're already comfortable in programming with C#

8
00:00:13,02 --> 00:00:15,00
and that you are familiar with

9
00:00:15,00 --> 00:00:16,09
some basic programming principles

10
00:00:16,09 --> 00:00:20,00
and common programming structures like loops

11
00:00:20,00 --> 00:00:23,07
and functions and classes and so on.

12
00:00:23,07 --> 00:00:25,09
After all, this is a course about Python

13
00:00:25,09 --> 00:00:28,00
for existing C# developers,

14
00:00:28,00 --> 00:00:29,09
so I think it's fair to expect

15
00:00:29,09 --> 00:00:33,03
that you're already a knowledgeable C# developer.

16
00:00:33,03 --> 00:00:35,09
I'm also going to assume that you are familiar with

17
00:00:35,09 --> 00:00:40,06
using IDE to build programs such as Visual Studio Code.

18
00:00:40,06 --> 00:00:43,08
I'm going to be using Visual Studio Code in this course,

19
00:00:43,08 --> 00:00:46,06
since it's free and it runs on all major platforms

20
00:00:46,06 --> 00:00:48,08
like Mac, Windows, and Linux,

21
00:00:48,08 --> 00:00:53,00
and it has really great support for both C# and Python.

22
00:00:53,00 --> 00:00:55,03
If you want to learn more about using Visual Studio

23
00:00:55,03 --> 00:00:56,07
to write Python code,

24
00:00:56,07 --> 00:01:00,04
then I suggest watching "Visual Studio Code for Python."

25
00:01:00,04 --> 00:01:03,02
Other than that, you don't really need to know much else.

26
00:01:03,02 --> 00:01:04,02
I'm not going to assume

27
00:01:04,02 --> 00:01:07,02
that you have any prior knowledge of Python, but if you do,

28
00:01:07,02 --> 00:01:09,05
then the course will be that much easier for you.

29
00:01:09,05 --> 00:01:11,05
Assuming that you're okay with these expectations,

30
00:01:11,05 --> 00:01:14,00
then you are ready to continue with the course.
