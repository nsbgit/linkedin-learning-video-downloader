00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,01
- [Instructor] In order to complete this course,

2
00:00:02,01 --> 00:00:03,07
you'll need to have both .NET

3
00:00:03,07 --> 00:00:06,09
with C# and Python installed on your computer.

4
00:00:06,09 --> 00:00:10,00
So let's start with the C# requirements.

5
00:00:10,00 --> 00:00:12,05
If you don't already have .NET installed,

6
00:00:12,05 --> 00:00:13,09
then in your browser,

7
00:00:13,09 --> 00:00:16,08
go to .net.microsoft.com

8
00:00:16,08 --> 00:00:19,05
and then click on the download button.

9
00:00:19,05 --> 00:00:21,09
Now, if this screen looks different when you visit,

10
00:00:21,09 --> 00:00:24,08
then you can always do a web search for .NET install

11
00:00:24,08 --> 00:00:26,00
and go from there.

12
00:00:26,00 --> 00:00:27,07
So here on the download page,

13
00:00:27,07 --> 00:00:29,06
the version for your operating system

14
00:00:29,06 --> 00:00:31,06
should already be selected.

15
00:00:31,06 --> 00:00:32,05
You want to make sure

16
00:00:32,05 --> 00:00:35,01
that you download the SDK version of .NET

17
00:00:35,01 --> 00:00:37,08
so that you can both build and run your apps.

18
00:00:37,08 --> 00:00:41,00
Don't just download the runtime version of .NET.

19
00:00:41,00 --> 00:00:44,08
So for Windows, what I'm going to choose is .NET SDK,

20
00:00:44,08 --> 00:00:48,00
which is let's see, it looks like it's right here,

21
00:00:48,00 --> 00:00:51,02
the .NET Core SDK.

22
00:00:51,02 --> 00:00:53,01
And by the way, on Windows, choose .Net Core.

23
00:00:53,01 --> 00:00:54,07
You don't need to choose .NET Framework,

24
00:00:54,07 --> 00:00:56,09
that's for building like Windows apps and so on.

25
00:00:56,09 --> 00:00:59,01
We're only going to be building console apps.

26
00:00:59,01 --> 00:01:01,07
So just download the .NET Core SDK.

27
00:01:01,07 --> 00:01:02,09
And then if you're on Linux,

28
00:01:02,09 --> 00:01:05,02
you're going to install .NET Core.

29
00:01:05,02 --> 00:01:06,06
That's this guy right here.

30
00:01:06,06 --> 00:01:08,03
And then finally on Mac iOS,

31
00:01:08,03 --> 00:01:12,03
once again, you're going to choose the .NET Core SDK.

32
00:01:12,03 --> 00:01:13,02
So alternatively,

33
00:01:13,02 --> 00:01:18,03
if you're using a Windows or a Mac, and not Linux,

34
00:01:18,03 --> 00:01:19,03
then you can choose

35
00:01:19,03 --> 00:01:22,05
to download the full Visual Studio itself.

36
00:01:22,05 --> 00:01:24,03
And that will also install the runtime

37
00:01:24,03 --> 00:01:26,08
and the SDKs that you need.

38
00:01:26,08 --> 00:01:30,06
So once you've downloaded and run the .NET installer,

39
00:01:30,06 --> 00:01:33,03
you're going to want to open a terminal window,

40
00:01:33,03 --> 00:01:35,00
and I'm using PowerShell,

41
00:01:35,00 --> 00:01:39,09
and you're going to type the command dotnet --version.

42
00:01:39,09 --> 00:01:42,07
And this should give you a version number

43
00:01:42,07 --> 00:01:43,06
of the .NET framework.

44
00:01:43,06 --> 00:01:45,09
Now, if this command results in an error,

45
00:01:45,09 --> 00:01:48,01
then something went wrong with the installation,

46
00:01:48,01 --> 00:01:49,09
and you'll need to do that again.

47
00:01:49,09 --> 00:01:52,02
Otherwise you should see a version number like this.

48
00:01:52,02 --> 00:01:56,08
You can see I'm using .NET Core 3.1.402.

49
00:01:56,08 --> 00:02:00,00
After you've installed .NET, you can install Python again,

50
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:01,05
if you don't already have it.

51
00:02:01,05 --> 00:02:04,01
So what you'll do is go to python.org

52
00:02:04,01 --> 00:02:06,03
and then you'll click on Downloads,

53
00:02:06,03 --> 00:02:08,08
and then follow the instructions for your platform.

54
00:02:08,08 --> 00:02:10,07
And again, your platform should already be selected,

55
00:02:10,07 --> 00:02:13,07
but you can manually choose the right platform

56
00:02:13,07 --> 00:02:14,07
if you need to.

57
00:02:14,07 --> 00:02:15,05
And for this course,

58
00:02:15,05 --> 00:02:19,06
it's not necessary to install anything later than 3.8.

59
00:02:19,06 --> 00:02:22,01
So if you've got 3.8 installed on your system,

60
00:02:22,01 --> 00:02:23,00
you should be fine.

61
00:02:23,00 --> 00:02:26,02
You can see that as of this recording, 3.9 is the latest,

62
00:02:26,02 --> 00:02:29,00
but as long as you have 3.8 plus, that's fine.

63
00:02:29,00 --> 00:02:31,00
And then once again, once you've installed,

64
00:02:31,00 --> 00:02:34,05
let's go back to the terminal window,

65
00:02:34,05 --> 00:02:35,08
and we're going to make sure that that worked.

66
00:02:35,08 --> 00:02:38,06
So we're going to type python.

67
00:02:38,06 --> 00:02:39,05
On Mac and Linux,

68
00:02:39,05 --> 00:02:41,03
you might need to type python3,

69
00:02:41,03 --> 00:02:42,09
because those systems still ship

70
00:02:42,09 --> 00:02:45,03
with Python2 installed sometimes.

71
00:02:45,03 --> 00:02:47,04
So make sure that you're running Python version three.

72
00:02:47,04 --> 00:02:49,08
Here on Windows, it's just the command python.

73
00:02:49,08 --> 00:02:52,08
Type python --version.

74
00:02:52,08 --> 00:02:55,04
And you can see that I'm running 3.8.

75
00:02:55,04 --> 00:02:56,04
And then finally,

76
00:02:56,04 --> 00:02:59,05
if you've decided to use Visual Studio Code,

77
00:02:59,05 --> 00:03:01,00
and you need to install it,

78
00:03:01,00 --> 00:03:04,06
then go to code.visualstudio.com.

79
00:03:04,06 --> 00:03:07,08
And again, just install the app for your platform.

80
00:03:07,08 --> 00:03:11,00
Once you've installed it, go ahead and open the app.

81
00:03:11,00 --> 00:03:12,08
And I've got the app open here,

82
00:03:12,08 --> 00:03:17,01
and click on the icon for Visual Studio Code extensions,

83
00:03:17,01 --> 00:03:20,00
which is the small icon here on the bottom.

84
00:03:20,00 --> 00:03:21,08
It shows all these squares coming together.

85
00:03:21,08 --> 00:03:23,00
So if we click on that one,

86
00:03:23,00 --> 00:03:26,01
you'll see the installed extensions,

87
00:03:26,01 --> 00:03:29,00
and you can see I've got C# and Python extensions

88
00:03:29,00 --> 00:03:30,03
already installed.

89
00:03:30,03 --> 00:03:33,03
Both of these are made and supported by Microsoft.

90
00:03:33,03 --> 00:03:34,05
These extensions will give you

91
00:03:34,05 --> 00:03:36,06
some really great language support features,

92
00:03:36,06 --> 00:03:38,02
such as syntax highlighting

93
00:03:38,02 --> 00:03:40,05
and IntelliSense, debugging support,

94
00:03:40,05 --> 00:03:41,09
and a whole lot more.

95
00:03:41,09 --> 00:03:43,07
Now, if you need to install these,

96
00:03:43,07 --> 00:03:45,05
then what you'll do is in the search box up here,

97
00:03:45,05 --> 00:03:48,07
you'll type C#,

98
00:03:48,07 --> 00:03:50,04
and typically it's the first one that comes up,

99
00:03:50,04 --> 00:03:52,04
and you can see it's made by Microsoft,

100
00:03:52,04 --> 00:03:53,02
that's the one you want.

101
00:03:53,02 --> 00:03:55,04
So go ahead and install that one.

102
00:03:55,04 --> 00:03:56,08
And then when that's finished,

103
00:03:56,08 --> 00:03:57,07
you're going to go ahead

104
00:03:57,07 --> 00:04:01,02
and you're going to search for Python.

105
00:04:01,02 --> 00:04:04,02
And once again, that's usually the first one at the top.

106
00:04:04,02 --> 00:04:06,03
You can see it's got, you know, as of this recording,

107
00:04:06,03 --> 00:04:09,08
almost 27 million downloads, again, made by Microsoft.

108
00:04:09,08 --> 00:04:12,01
And this is the one you want to install.

109
00:04:12,01 --> 00:04:15,03
Now you might need to reload VS Code after installing.

110
00:04:15,03 --> 00:04:17,06
So if you see a little blue reload button

111
00:04:17,06 --> 00:04:18,07
next to the extension name,

112
00:04:18,07 --> 00:04:21,04
then go ahead and do it after you install.

113
00:04:21,04 --> 00:04:22,02
All right.

114
00:04:22,02 --> 00:04:24,08
So after you've installed Python.net and VS Code

115
00:04:24,08 --> 00:04:28,00
and the extensions, then you're ready to proceed.
